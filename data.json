      "message": "Wonderful human! Musicals with Bryan were mystical. Have a problem? Need a fire onstage? Ask Bryan and he would magically manifest one-safely! Bubbling water-no problem. A glass that would break without shattering/he did it! Loved creating with Bryan. One of the beautiful and unique opportunities at Eastwood were the fun times we had collaborating and solving problems for productions. Mr. Kaufman was a genius, always with a twinkle in his eye and a knowing smirk that his wizardry would unfold seamlessly! Respect and admiration galore!",
